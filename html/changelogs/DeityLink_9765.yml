changes:
  - bugfix: Blobs cannot destroy docking ports anymore.
  - bugfix: The Blob Overmind's HUD now properly indicates how much health his core has.
  - rscadd: Added a lot of messages to Blob Overminds that trigger under a variety of conditions. Such as blobs near their core dying, a special blob that they've placed having been destroyed, or their core getting damaged.
  - rscadd: If there are multiple Blob Overminds in the world, they get instantly notified by the death of one of them. They also get notified by the death of any blob core, whether it had an overmind or not.
