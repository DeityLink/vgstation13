 changes:
  - tweak: You can now label evidence and sample bags with a pen.
  - bugfix: Dialogue for library shelves now have a cancel button.
  - bugfix: Kinda fixed Ctrl + Clicking for releasing a pulled object, it behaves slightly differently now. Ctrl + click something unmovable (the floor) or something out of range to stop pulling the object.
